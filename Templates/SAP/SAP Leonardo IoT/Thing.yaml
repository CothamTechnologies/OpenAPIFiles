  title: Thing
  description: |-
    A thing is an instance of a thing type. Thing type and thing have a one-to-many relationship, that is, one thing type may be referenced by many things, while each thing is defined by exactly one thing type. For example, you can create a thing of a specific car model ABCXSeries of thing type Automobiles and specify values for the attributes defined in the Automobiles thing type. You can use the thing services to create, delete, and retrieve things, and reading data such as properties, time series and so on.

    The operations under Thing Metadata are deprecated. Please find the enhanced version of these operations at [Thing Configuration OData](/api/ThingConfiguration/resource) under ThingTypes and PropertySetTypes.

      summary: Creates a thing
      description: With this method, you can create a thing instance. Thing type and thing have a one-to-many relationship, that is, one thing type may be referenced by many things, while each thing is defined by exactly one thing type. The thing type has to be fully qualified name that is prefixed with the package name. For example, core.automobiles:ABCXSeries. When you assign an object group to a thing, you are allowed to carry out the functions based on the capabilities defined in the object group.

      description: With this method, you can retrieve time series data for a specific property type of a thing by applying the M4 algorithm. This algorithm is used to aggregate the time series data for n number of divisions. Divisions correspond to the number of intervals into which the given time range needs to be divided. For each interval, the service returns unique minimum value, maximum value, first occurring value, and last occurring value, if they exist. Hence, there would be a maximum of four values per division returned. This service only supports property set types of data categories TimeSeriesData and DerivedData.

      summary: Retrieves time series data for multiple properties of a thing applying M4 algorithm
      description: With this method, you can read the time series data for multiple properties of the specified thing by applying the M4 algorithm. This algorithm is used to aggregate the time series data for n number of divisions. Divisions correspond to the number of intervals into which the given time range needs to be divided. For each interval, the service returns unique minimum value, maximum value, first occurring value, and last occurring value, if they exist. Hence, there would be a maximum of four values per division returned. This service only supports property set types of data categories TimeSeriesData and DerivedData.
